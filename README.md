 Densely Packed BCD converter (DPBCD -> Packed BCD = Unpacked BCD = Decimal)
 
This project was created during my second year of college and our group was tasked to create a program, given a densely packed BCD string and convert it into its packed bcd, unpacked bcd, and decimal equivalents.


To use: download the project and open the jar file to view the project. After inputting a string, press enter to check for its equivalent. The bottom right button is to clear the text.
